% BODY OF ALL SUBLIMINAL LETTERS *******************************************

\def \body
{This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552. 

I request that copies of the following documents be provided to me:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Any and all documents pertaining to the use of subliminal stimuli
	({\it e.g.} embedded images or words, 
	low-intensity light or sound, tachistoscopic displays) in 
	advertising, government operations, or other fields.
	
	\item  Any and all documents pertaining to companies or organizations
	that create, distribute, or sell subliminal material (including but not
	limited to Osman-Kord, Ltd. (Southern California), Proactive
	Systems (Portland, Oregon), and Stimutech, Inc. (East Lansing,
	Michigan)).
	
	\item Any and all documents pertaining to laws, statutes, regulations,
	or legal cases concerning subliminal stimuli.
	
	\item Any and all documents pertaining to the effectiveness 
	or non-effectiveness of subliminal stimuli.
\end{enumerate}

I realize that the law may allow your agency to withhold specified 
categories or exempted information, but would like to remind you that it 
also requires you to release any ``segregable'' portions that are left over 
after exempt material is deleted.  Please also provide me with the name of 
the official to which administrative appeals should be directed.  If this 
request for documents is denied, I would like to receive a detailed 
justification for denial.

I request a waiver of all fees for this request.  Disclosure of the 
requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely 
to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of corporations, the government, and the media, and is not 
primarily in my commercial interest.  I plan to make this information 
available over the internet; this will benefit the general public because 
the news media does not often report on this subject and the information I 
will make available will be an important resource for those who are 
concerned that subliminal messages may be in use (and will perhaps put to 
rest many questions as to the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of such 
material).  It would thus be unfair to make the first requester bear the 
full cost of the initial search for these documents.  To further determine 
my status to assess fees, you should know that I am affiliated with an 
educational institution, and this request is made for a scholarly purpose 
and not for a commercial use.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.}
