\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

Please remove the names, telephone number, and address listed below from 
any and all lists used for telemarketing solicitations or other purposes.  
I do not accept such calls, and would like to receive less of them in 
the future.

This address was given to me by a telemarketer when I asked to be removed 
from her company's lists.  I am curious what lists you have control over 
or access to; I would appreciate it if you would send me documentation 
describing what lists exist, how the names are distributed or sold, and 
the ways in which your company is involved in these processes.  

Finally, if you know 
of any other services that are able to remove my personal information and 
telephone number from such lists, please also send me contact information.

Thank you very much.

\closing{Respectfully,}
