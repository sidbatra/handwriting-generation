\opening{Dear \input{name.tex},}


Every 13 minutes, a woman dies from this. 

If any woman you know between the ages of 15 and 54 dies, the most likely cause will be this same thing.

Breast cancer.

Without the support of people like you, 10 million people could die of it in the next 25 years.

You don't need to be a volunteer or an activist to help.  Anything you do in your own special way can help make a difference to Susan G. Komen for the CureÂ® which strives to raise funds and educate people in the battle against breast cancer through global events and legislative actions each year.

You can choose to raise awareness and funds by participating in an event, such as the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Become an activist to achieve important legislative objectives. Or simply make a monetary contribution. But no matter how you give, every bit helps support the Komen global mission of ending breast cancer.

Breast cancer patients and their families across America thank you for your time and generosity.

\closing{Sincerely,}
